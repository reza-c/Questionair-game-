Game Scenario:

There is an IT company and wants to hire Cybersecurity Professionals to fill the open positions. The company decided to design the scenario base game for all candidates to evaluate their proficiency in case of cyber attacks and also test their knowledge about Cybersecurity.

 
 
·         Game has start and exit button
·         When the first player inserts his name and then clicks on start, it will go to the game page
·         In the game page, there are multiple barriers and if the player answers the question correctly, it will get a 100 score and goes to the next step which is the next question. If not, the score will not change.
·         It has multiple Q/A scenarios. It could be 10 questions more or less and if the player answers at least 9 questions correctly, the player can win and will be hired as a Cybersecurity professional in the company. If not, it will fail and the New Candidate will start the game.
·         It can be some barriers like 10 barriers (walls or bridges) and in each barrier a question pops up with multiple choice answers
·         if it passes all barriers with the minimum score of 900, it will win and the message pops up, " congratulations you are hired!" and if less than 900, the message pops up,” sorry you will not be hired”
Basically, it’s a game to hire an employee who can answer at least 9 questions correctly and pass all steps.
